# How it works?

### How it works?

The flow for asset transfers on the Matic Network is as follows:

- User deposits crypto assets in Matic contract on mainchain
- Once deposited tokens get confirmed on the main chain, the corresponding tokens will get reflected on the Matic chain.
- The user can now transfer tokens to anyone they want instantly with negligible fees. Matic chain has faster blocks (approximately ~ 1 second). That way, the transfer will be done almost instantly.
- Once a user is ready, they can withdraw remaining tokens from the mainchain by establishing proof of remaining tokens on Root contract (contract deployed on Ethereum chain)

### Network and version

- Network is network name you want to use e.g mainnet or testnet

- version is network verstion e.g v1, v2, mumbai

### Contracts and addresses

You don't have to worry about contract addresses, giving correct network name and version will pickup respective addresses :grinning:
